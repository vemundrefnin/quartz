# The Oregon Trail
Lottery in Oregon in 2008 where applicants could have a chance to win Health insurance.
It was aimed at a special group of people (think low income Americans), and applicants won a chance  to apply for the insurance. Not all winners applied for health insurance. It was a 25% increased chance that the winners (target group) would get insurance compared to the losers ([[control group]]).

The results of the OHP lottery disappointed policymakers who looked to publicly provide insurance to generate a health dividend for low-income Americans.
Winners were less likely to have incurred large medical expenses or to have accumulated debt generated by the need to pay for health care. It may be this improvement in financial health that accounts for improved mental health in the treatment group. 

Health care services increases sharply in response to insurance coverage, while it reveals little of an insurance effect on physical health.

This and the [[RAND]] (another randomized trail research) both suggest that subsidized public health insurance should not be expected to yield a dramatic health dividend.
