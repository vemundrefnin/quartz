Visual Analytics shows how to understand the data and the audience, to craft the story from the data, and to determine the best visual model and details to use for that story. A picture speaks a thousand data points. In a data-driven world, the ability to display large amounts of data through powerful visualization tools is important for business success. By the end of the course, students will be able to use powerful visual analysis tools â€“â€“ to manage and visualize data.Â \n\n## Student Learning Outcomes\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\n1.  Understand Data Visualization Principles\n2.  Apply technology for Visual Analytics\n3.  Illustrate complex data with simple visualizations\n\n## Required Textbook(s)\n-   **Book Title:**Â Â Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals\n-   **ISBN-10:**Â 1119002257Â  Â  Â  Â  Â \n-   **ISBN-13:**Â 978-1119002253\n-   [E-Book Link](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Storytelling+with+Data%3A+A+Data+Visualization+Guide+for+Business+Professionals-p-9781119002253 \"Link\")\n\n## Course Software\n[SAS for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html)\n[R Studio](https://rstudio.com/)\n\n## Class Attendance\nWhile class attendance is mandatory for all class session, the following dates forÂ Class Attendance isÂ **REQUIRED,**Â as indicated below.\n\n1.  **August 24th**, 6:00 pm\n2.  **August 31st**, 6:00 pm\n3.  **October 5th**, 6:00 pm\n4.  **November 30th**, 6:00 pm\n5.  **December 7th**, 6:00 pm\n\nWeekly labs are counted toward the overall class grade as indicated in the Syllabus.

You can understand the context by answering the following questions: \n- Who (To whom are you communicating?)\n- What (What do you want your audience to know?)\n- How (How can you use data to help make a point?)\n\nIt is also a good thing to answer the questions below to get a better understanding of the context. This is especially helpful if someone other than you is requesting the visualization.\n- What background information is relevant or essential?\n- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know abut them?\n- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?\n- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audience familiar with this data, or is it new?\n- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?\n- What would a successful outcome look like?\n- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?\n\n## Example of Data Visualization Context\nI want to sell Donuts in Norway.\nWho: To potential investors.\nWhat: The popularity of donuts is increasing in Norway, please invest 1 million dollars.\nHow: The number of places to buy donuts in Norway is increasing.\n\nOda BjÃ¸nnes Hanslien.

The second, $Y_{0,Khuzdar} âˆ’ Y_{0,Maria}$, is the difference between the two studentsâ€™ health status were both to decide against insurance. This term, equal to âˆ’2, reflects Khuzdarâ€™s relative frailty (weakness/easly sick). In the context of our effort to uncover causal effects, the lack of comparability captured by the second term is called **selection bias**.\n\nWe do the following to find the causal effect and selection bias for the average.\n$Y_i = Y_{0i} + \\kappa \u003c=\u003e  \\kappa = Y_i - Y_{0i}$\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163034.png)\n\nThis equation reveals that health comparisons between those with and without insurance equal the causal effect of interest ($\\kappa$) plus the difference in average $Y_{0i}$ between the insured and the uninsured. As in the parable of Khuzdar and Maria, this second term describes selection bias. Specifically, the difference in average health by insurance status can be written:\n![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020220904163351.png)\n\nTo fix the selection bias we strive to make [[ceteris paribus]]. This is done by finding the sources of selection bias, such as education. This bias is eliminated by focusing on samples of people with the same schooling, say, college graduates. \n\nThe selection bias is eliminated in [[randomized trials]].\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T03:50:39.604418247Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/The-Oregon-Trail":{"title":"The Oregon Trail","content":"# The Oregon Trail\nLottery in Oregon in 2008 where applicants could have a chance to win Health insurance.\nIt was aimed at a special group of people (think low income Americans), and applicants won a chance  to apply for the insurance. Not all winners applied for health insurance. It was a 25% increased chance that the winners (target group) would get insurance compared to the losers (control group).\n\nThe results of the OHP lottery disappointed policymakers who looked to publicly provide insurance to generate a health dividend for low-income Americans.\nWinners were less likely to have incurred large medical expenses or to have accumulated debt generated by the need to pay for health care. It may be this improvement in financial health that accounts for improved mental health in the treatment group. \n\nHealth care services increases sharply in response to insurance coverage, while it reveals little of an insurance effect on physical health.\n\nThis and the [[RAND]] (another randomized trail research) both suggest that subsidized public health insurance should not be expected to yield a dramatic health dividend.\n\n\n# Related\n- [randomized trials](ECON5100%20-%20Seminar%20Applied%20Microeconomic%20Analysis/randomized%20trials.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-05T03:50:39.604418247Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/Week-2-Introduction-to-Applied-Economics":{"title":"","content":"# Week 2 Introduction to Applied Economics\n#econ5100 \n\nRead [[NBER Program Report Children]]\n\nWe are going to have an exam.
