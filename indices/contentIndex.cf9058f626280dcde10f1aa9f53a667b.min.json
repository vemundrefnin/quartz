Visual Analytics shows how to understand the data and the audience, to craft the story from the data, and to determine the best visual model and details to use for that story. A picture speaks a thousand data points. In a data-driven world, the ability to display large amounts of data through powerful visualization tools is important for business success. By the end of the course, students will be able to use powerful visual analysis tools â€“â€“ to manage and visualize data.Â \n\n## Student Learning Outcomes\nUpon successful completion of this course, students should be able to:\n1.  Understand Data Visualization Principles\n2.  Apply technology for Visual Analytics\n3.

How does this the proposed answer compare with that provided by previous research?\n5. What are the major logic or theoretical reasons for the authorÂ´s argument?\n6. What emperical evidence does the author provide?\n7. What assumptions is the author making his or her reasoning?\n\n## Evaluating the AuthorÂ´s argument\n1. Does the theoretical analysis make sense?\n2. Are the data used adequate to the task?\n3. Does the empirical methodology adequately?\n4. Are the assumptions reasonable?\n5. Is the analysis (theoretical and empirical) clearly explained?\n6. Do the conclusions follow from the evidence presented?\n7. On balance, is the authorÂ´s argument convincing to you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T19:48:55.407937973Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/Dr.-Gokhan-Kumpas":{"title":"","content":"# Dr. Gokhan Kumpas\n#person #professor \n\n\n**Office Location:**Â ST907\n\n**Email:**Â [gkumpas@calstatela.edu](mailto:gkumpas@calstatela.edu)\n\n**Office Hours:**Â Tuesdays: 3:00-4:00 PM \u0026 by appointment\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T19:48:55.407937973Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/ECON5100-Overview-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-analysis":{"title":"","content":"# ECON5100 Overview - Seminar: Applied Microeconomic analysis\n#econ5100 #course\nOn [canvas](https://calstatela.instructure.com/courses/83207)\n[[Dr. Gokhan Kumpas]]\nBooks (might find pdf versions for free):\n- Mastring metics (good book)\n- Mostly harmless econometrics (harder)\n\nDo not have to come to class\nMight be on zoom\n\nFree week 14, due to thanks-giving.\n\nRead article from [NBER](https://www.nber.org/) National Bureau of Economic Research\nmight be notation on bottom saying if it is \"published\"\n\nNo homework for next week.\n\n## Course Outline\nWeek 1 Course Introduction\n[[Week 2 Introduction to Applied Economics]]\n[[Week 3 The Economic Model \u0026 Understanding Evidence]]\n[[Week 4 Deepening the Economic Model of Behavior]]\n[[Week 5 Methodology Case Study: Differences in Differences]]\n[[Week 6 Early Life Influences and the Fetal Origins Literature]]\n[[Week 7 Environment and Health]]\n[[Week 8 Race, Policing, and Criminal Justice]]\n[[Week 9 Crime]]\n[[Week 10 Racial Discrimination]]\n[[Week 10 Gender in Labor Market]]\n[[Week 11 Gender and Crime]]\n[[Week 12 Mental Health]]\n[[Week 13 Presenting Results]]\n[[Week 14 Thanksgiving: Over Eat \u0026 Relax!]]\n[[Week 15 Working on Term Projects]]\n[[Week 16 Final Submission]]\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T19:48:55.407937973Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/NBER-Program-Report-Children":{"title":"","content":"# NBER Program Report Children\n#NBER\nby [Janet Currie](https://www.nber.org/people/janet_currie)Â \u0026Â [Anna Aizer](https://www.nber.org/people/anna_aizer)\n\nThe [article link](https://www.nber.org/reporter/2016number4/program-report-children)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-04T19:48:55.407937973Z","tags":null},"/ECON5100-Seminar-Applied-Microeconomic-Analysis/Week-2-Introduction-to-Applied-Economics":{"title":"","content":"# Week 2 Introduction to Applied Economics\n#econ5100 \n\nRead [[NBER Program Report Children]]\n\nWe are going to have an exam.
